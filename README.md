# agent-based-SIR-recovery

Elements of project:
- NetLogo simulation
  - Look at one already, make improvements
  - Download CSV data
- Use data to derive SIR model: http://databookuw.com/databook.pdf page 290
  - Watch videos in book abt SINDY
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSCa78TIldg
- If we increase infectiousness in simulation, SINDY should show beta be higher
  - lambda determines how many close to zero terms you can tolerate 

Goals:
- Apr 1 - NetLogo Data recieved
- Apr 8 - Run simulated data through SINDY
- Apr 15 - Run model and SINDY with different parameters and added terms
- Apr 22 - Analysis done
- Apr 25 - Presentation done
- Apr 27 - Present
- May 4 - Final paper due
