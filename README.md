# agent-based-SIR-recovery

Elements of project:
- NetLogo simulation
  - Look at one already, make improvements
  - Download CSV data
- Use data to derive SIR model: http://databookuw.com/databook.pdf page 290
  - Watch videos in book abt SINDY
- If we increase infectiousness in simulation, SINDY should show beta be higher

Todo:
build netlogo, figure out how to extract vectors of S and I 

Goals:
Apr 1 - NetLogo Data recieved
Apr 8 - Run simulated data through SINDY
Apr 15 - Run model and SINDY with different parameters and added terms
Apr 22 - Analysis done
Apr 25 - Presentation done
Apr 27 - Present
May 4 - Final paper due
